# REST-API
This is Laurelle's local Character REST API.

It includes a Client, Server and Database, developed in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP & SQL. It requires the [PHP-JWT library](https://github.com/firebase/php-jwt).

It allows users to visit the website, sign up and log in, which is authenticated by JWTs, and interact with the API.
